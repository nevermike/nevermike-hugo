### And how it can bring value to your practice<!--more-->

**My working definition of design thinking:** An approach that put the humans at the heart of what you’re making, within technical constraints of your product, and the goals of your business.

## Start from the customer’s point of view
**People first.** Work to understand they people using your product and ask them for feedback.

## Involve multiple disciplines in planning
**Find the experts.** Design benefits by have diverse people contribute their knowledge to a project.

## Create collaboration spaces
**Make it tangible.** Shared understand increases When ideas share a place outside of your brain.

## Be agile and embrace change
**Stay flexible.** When you learn something new use what you’ve learned to improve what you’re making.

## Develop a risk-taking culture
**Don’t break things.** Do create an environment where your team supports each other and feels safe challenging perceived norms.

## OK, hippie
All this peace, love, and understanding didn’t move you? How about money? [According to Forrester Research](https://go.forrester.com/blogs/design-thinking-can-deliver-an-roi-of-85-or-greater/), developing mature design thinking practices contribute to a “substantial measurable returns and a broad range of auxiliary benefits”, with a return on investment of 85%.
