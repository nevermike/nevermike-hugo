### A running list of the podcasts I’m listing to<!--more-->

Podcasts listed were publishing and I am currently subscribed to as of publishing.

**Attention Level Key:**

<span class="listlabel low">Low</span> I listen to when I’m working remotely and need some background sounds, but my main focus is elsewhere

<span class="listlabel mid">Medium</span> These are the majority of my subscriptions, I listen to these when I’m commuting or doing the dishes. If my attention wanders, I’m not loosing the point of the episode

<span class="listlabel hi">High</span> These need more attention because they are used for learning. If I get distracted, I’ll rewind what I missed
