After graduating from The School of Visual Arts, I kicked-off my career during the early days of NYC’s Silicon Alley. I learned a lot about how to adapt design principles to the web, taught myself how to make websites, and fell in love with helping people use digital products to improve their lives. Now, I use these skills to help business offer better experiences to customers.

#### Companies I've worked with include

### Teaching user experience and design thinking

I began teaching as an adjunct professor at Drexel’s Westphal College of Media Arts & Design in the early ’00s. My classes focused on helping graphic design students translate their talents to digital products. Currently, I teach at the University of the Arts. Through the continuing education department, I help people develop their skills and explore careers in user experience design.

I’m super proud that a number of my students are leading the current, and next waves of design in Philadelphia and around the country.
