## Human-centered business solutions

### I help companies deliver great experiences to their customers

***

After graduating from The School of Visual Arts, my career kicked-off during the early days of NYC’s Silicon Alley. I learned a lot about how to adapt design principles to the web, taught myself how to make websites, and used these skills to help business offer better experiences to customers.

#### Companies I've worked with include

As a user experience designer, I work with mid-to-large B2B, and B2C companies to explore new ideas and design products. For more information about my professional services, please [check out my profile on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelestok).

### Teaching user experience and design thinking

I began teaching as an adjunct professor at Drexel’s Westphal College of Media Arts & Design in the early ’00s. My classes focused on helping graphic design students translate their talents to digital products. Currently, I teach at the University of the Arts. Through the continuing education department, I help people develop their skills and explore careers in user experience design.

I’m super proud that a number of my students are leading the current, and next waves of design in Philadelphia and around the country.
