<blockquote>
<p>A human-centered approach to creative problem-solving
Expanding further, it’s an approach that put the person using your stuff at the hart of what you’re making, within technical constraints and the goals of your business.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="spoiler-it-s-not-new">Spoiler - It’s not new</h4>

<p>Though design thinking as been recognized recently by many business (thanks in large part to Stanford’s D School), it’s been brewing since the 50s. Why then? People needed a new way to understand the nascent digital world that was developing around them.</p>

<p>There were two primary, divergent approaches. Buckminster Fuller provided one. He sought out experts in the specific fields that affected the project, and bought them together as a think tank. The Scandinavian Design Co-op were the other side of the coin. They started testing processes and systems with the people who would be using the final product. Put these two approaches together and you have a pretty good facsimile of modern product design.</p>

<p>The concepts they introduced carried on though the 80s and 90s. Business started to try to figure out how designers could come up with many divergent ideas. In the 2000s studios like IDEO and Frog codified design theories into an approach that could applied to business and product problems.</p>

<h2 id="what-does-it-look-like">What does it look like?</h2>

<p>Do an image search for <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=design+thinking&amp;t=osx&amp;iar=images&amp;ia=images">design thinking</a> and you’ll find endless circles, hexagons, and diamonds illustrating the steps to through the practice of design thinking. These illustrations give the impression it&rsquo;s linear processes &ndash; it’s not. The pillars (empathize, define, ideate, prototype, and test) are points of interest, not a guided tour.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Design thinking is not a cookbook where the answer falls out the end. It’s messier than that. It’s a big mass of looping back to different places in the process <span>David Kelly, IDEO<span></p>

<p>Don’t break things. Do create an environment where your team supports each other and feels safe challenging the norm.</p>

<h2 id="ok-hippie">OK, hippie</h2>

<p>If all the peace, love, and understanding didn’t move you, how about money?<a href="https://go.forrester.com/blogs/design-thinking-can-deliver-an-roi-of-85-or-greater/">According to Forrester Research</a>, developing mature design thinking practices contribute to, “substantial measurable returns and a broad range of auxiliary benefits”, with a return on investment of 85%.</p>
